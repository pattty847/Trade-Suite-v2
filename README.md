## Introduction

TradeSuite is a multi-exchange cryptocurrency trading platform built using DearPyGUI and CCXT PRO. It provides a real-time streaming interface for multiple instances of the same exchange, with features such as real-time candlestick charting and a real-time order book with price level zoom and aggregation toggle.

**Note:** A major architectural refactoring, introducing a fully dockable widget system and optimized data flow, is complete and available in a dedicated feature branch. This update significantly enhances performance and user interface flexibility.

## Features

- **Flexible Dockable Widget UI:** Build your personalized trading dashboard by docking, undocking, tabbing, and resizing widgets.
- **Persistent & Customizable Layouts:** Save your workspace layout and restore it automatically between sessions. Reset to a default layout anytime.
- **Efficient Multi-Exchange Data Streaming:** Real-time trades and order book updates via CCXT PRO WebSockets.
- **Optimized Shared Data Streams:** Display the same market (e.g., BTC/USDT) on multiple widgets (e.g., 1-minute chart, 1-hour chart, order book) simultaneously using a single, shared data connection for maximum efficiency.
- **Real-Time Candlestick Charting:** View live candlestick charts with configurable timeframes and indicators (e.g., EMA).
- **Real-Time Order Book:** Analyze market depth with price level aggregation and zoom capabilities.
- **Real-Time Price Level / DOM View:** Visualize aggregated market depth through the dedicated Price Level widget.
- **Modular Architecture:** Decoupled components for data handling, UI widgets, and external API integrations (like SEC EDGAR).
- **Sentinel Alert Bot:** A highly configurable alert system that monitors market conditions (price levels, CVD, percentage changes, etc.) and sends notifications. Operates integrated within TradeSuite or as a standalone terminal application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ 
- InfluxDB (local or cloud instance)
- Crypto Exchange key (for trading)
- SEC EDGAR API name and email (for their API requirements)

### Installation

The easiest way to install TradeSuite is using our automated installation script. Choose the appropriate method for your operating system:

#### macOS / Linux
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pattty847/Trade-Suite-v2.git
cd Trade-Suite-v2

# Make the installation script executable
chmod +x scripts/install.sh

# Run the installation script
./scripts/install.sh
```

#### Windows
```batch
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pattty847/Trade-Suite-v2.git

- **Real-Time Order Book Widget:** Shows live market depth with controls for price aggregation and zoom.
- **Real-Time Price Level (DOM) Widget:** A new widget providing a clear view of aggregated buy/sell pressure at different price levels.
- **Layout Persistence:** User-defined layouts are automatically saved (`user_layout.ini`) and restored. Factory default layout (`factory_layout.ini`) provided with reset capability.
- **Modular Component Design:** Refactored codebase with clear separation of concerns (Data Source, Task Manager, Widgets, SEC API Module).
- **Command-Line Interface:** Flexible application startup using `argparse` for setting exchanges, logging level, and layout reset.
- **Basic Multi-Exchange Support:** Foundation laid for connecting to and displaying data from multiple exchanges simultaneously (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).
- **Sentinel Alert Bot Integration:** Integrated the `sentinel.alert_bot` module for advanced, configurable market alerts (see dedicated section below).

## Sentinel Alert Bot

The `Sentinel Alert Bot` is a powerful, integrated module designed to provide users with timely notifications based on a wide range of configurable market conditions. It enhances TradeSuite by adding an intelligent monitoring layer.

**Key Characteristics:**

-   **Dual Mode Operation:** Can run seamlessly as part of the TradeSuite GUI (with potential UI notifications) or as a standalone, headless terminal application (e.g., for 24/7 server-based monitoring).
-   **Leverages TradeSuite Core:** Utilizes TradeSuite's robust `Data` class for all exchange interactions and `TaskManager` for managing data stream lifecycles, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
-   **Dedicated Configuration:** Alert rules, notification methods, and other parameters are defined in a separate YAML file (`sentinel/alert_bot/config/alerts_config.yaml`), allowing for detailed customization without altering core TradeSuite settings.
-   **Rich Alert Types:** Supports various alert conditions, including:
    -   Price Level Crossings (above/below)
    -   Percentage Price Changes (within a timeframe)
    -   Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) analysis (tracking changes, ratios, levels)
    -   (Future) Volatility breakouts, indicator-based alerts (MA crosses, RSI, etc.).
-   **Centralized Orchestration:** The `AlertDataManager` class within the bot is responsible for parsing configurations, subscribing to necessary data via `TaskManager`, processing incoming data (e.g., managing `CVDCalculator` instances), evaluating rules, and dispatching notifications through configured channels (e.g., console, email).

For detailed information on the Sentinel Alert Bot's specific setup, rule configuration, architecture, and standalone usage, please refer to its dedicated [README.md file](sentinel/alert_bot/README.md).

## Planned Features

   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 scripts/build/build_executable.py
   ```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist` folder, ready to distribute to users.

#### Option 2: Using UV for Package Management

UV is a modern Python packaging tool that offers significant performance improvements over pip:

1. Install UV:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Use UV for dependency management:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Create a lockfile for reproducible builds
   uv pip compile --output-file requirements.lock requirements.txt
   
   # Install from lockfile
   uv pip install -r requirements.lock
   ```

3. UV Virtual Environments:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

4. Export consolidated dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip freeze > requirements-frozen.txt
   ```

UV offers faster installation times, better dependency resolution, and is 100% compatible with pip. For more information, visit the [UV documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
