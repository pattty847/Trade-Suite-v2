## Introduction

TradeSuite is a multi-exchange cryptocurrency trading platform built using DearPyGUI and CCXT PRO. It provides a real-time streaming interface for multiple instances of the same exchange, with features such as real-time candlestick charting and a real-time order book with price level zoom and aggregation toggle.

**Note:** A major architectural refactoring, introducing a fully dockable widget system and optimized data flow, is complete and available in a dedicated feature branch. This update significantly enhances performance and user interface flexibility.

## Features

- **Flexible Dockable Widget UI:** Build your personalized trading dashboard by docking, undocking, tabbing, and resizing widgets.
- **Persistent & Customizable Layouts:** Save your workspace layout and restore it automatically between sessions. Reset to a default layout anytime.
- **Efficient Multi-Exchange Data Streaming:** Real-time trades and order book updates via CCXT PRO WebSockets.
- **Optimized Shared Data Streams:** Display the same market (e.g., BTC/USDT) on multiple widgets (e.g., 1-minute chart, 1-hour chart, order book) simultaneously using a single, shared data connection for maximum efficiency.
- **Real-Time Candlestick Charting:** View live candlestick charts with configurable timeframes and indicators (e.g., EMA).
- **Real-Time Order Book:** Analyze market depth with price level aggregation and zoom capabilities.
- **Real-Time Price Level / DOM View:** Visualize aggregated market depth through the dedicated Price Level widget.
- **Modular Architecture:** Decoupled components for data handling, UI widgets, and external API integrations (like SEC EDGAR).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ 
- InfluxDB (local or cloud instance)
- Crypto Exchange key (for trading)
- SEC EDGAR API name and email (for their API requirements)

### Installation

The easiest way to install TradeSuite is using our automated installation script. Choose the appropriate method for your operating system:

#### macOS / Linux
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pattty847/Trade-Suite-v2.git
cd Trade-Suite-v2

# Make the installation script executable
chmod +x scripts/install.sh

# Run the installation script
./scripts/install.sh
```

#### Windows
```batch
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pattty847/Trade-Suite-v2.git
cd Trade-Suite-v2

# Run the installation script
scripts\install.bat
```

The installation script will:
- Check your Python version
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies using UV (recommended) or pip
- Set up your environment file

> **Note**: The script will prompt you to choose between UV (recommended) or pip for package installation. UV is significantly faster and more reliable, especially for packages that require compilation.

#### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pattty847/Trade-Suite-v2.git
   cd Trade-Suite-v2
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Using venv (standard)
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install uv (recommended for faster installation)
   pip install uv
   
   # Install dependencies using uv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Important**: TA-Lib requires C++ libraries:
   - **Windows**: Download and install the wheel from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib)
   - **macOS**: `brew install ta-lib`
   - **Linux**: `apt-get install ta-lib`

### Environment Setup

1. Configure your environment variables:

   ```bash
   # Copy the template file
   cp .env.template .env
   
   # Edit the .env file with your API keys and credentials
   ```

2. Required API services:
   - InfluxDB (for data storage)
   - Exchange API keys (Coinbase, etc.)
   - Any additional services used

3. Configure InfluxDB:
   - Make sure InfluxDB is running locally (or you have cloud access)
   - Create buckets: "trades", "market_data", "candles", "orderbook"
   - Update your .env file with the correct tokens and organization

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: One-Click Startup (Recommended for New Users)

Simply double-click the appropriate script for your operating system:

- **Windows**: Double-click `run.bat`
- **macOS/Linux**: Double-click `run.sh` (or run `./run.sh` in terminal)

These scripts will automatically:
- Check if your setup is complete
- Run the installation script if needed
- Start the application with default settings

#### Option 2: Command Line (Advanced Users)

You can run the application manually:

```bash
# Run as a Python module (recommended)
python -m trade_suite

# With specific exchanges
python -m trade_suite --exchanges coinbase binance

# With debug logging
python -m trade_suite --level DEBUG

# To reset to the default layout
python -m trade_suite --reset-layout
```

## Implemented Features

- **Complete UI Overhaul:** Fully dockable widget system built with DearPyGUI, allowing flexible user layouts.
- **Optimized Data Architecture:** Decoupled data flow managed by a central `TaskManager`, enabling shared WebSocket streams and efficient multi-widget updates. Significantly reduces resource consumption compared to previous versions.
- **Centralized Task Management:** Robust handling of asynchronous data streams and background processing tasks.
- **Real-Time Candlestick Widget:** Displays live charts with EMA indicators, updated directly from trade streams.
- **Real-Time Order Book Widget:** Shows live market depth with controls for price aggregation and zoom.
- **Real-Time Price Level (DOM) Widget:** A new widget providing a clear view of aggregated buy/sell pressure at different price levels.
- **Layout Persistence:** User-defined layouts are automatically saved (`user_layout.ini`) and restored. Factory default layout (`factory_layout.ini`) provided with reset capability.
- **Modular Component Design:** Refactored codebase with clear separation of concerns (Data Source, Task Manager, Widgets, SEC API Module).
- **Command-Line Interface:** Flexible application startup using `argparse` for setting exchanges, logging level, and layout reset.
- **Basic Multi-Exchange Support:** Foundation laid for connecting to and displaying data from multiple exchanges simultaneously (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).

## Planned Features

- **Trading Capabilities:** Execute buy/sell orders directly through the platform interface.
- **Order Interface Development:** Dedicated widgets/panels for managing open orders, positions, and trade history.
- **Multi-Exchange Portfolio Management:** Aggregate and track assets across multiple connected exchanges.
- **Expansion of Technical Indicators:** Add a wider variety of popular technical indicators to the charting widget.

   ```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist` folder, ready to distribute to users.

#### Option 2: Using UV for Package Management

UV is a modern Python packaging tool that offers significant performance improvements over pip:

1. Install UV:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Use UV for dependency management:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Create a lockfile for reproducible builds
   uv pip compile --output-file requirements.lock requirements.txt
   
   # Install from lockfile
   uv pip install -r requirements.lock
   ```

3. UV Virtual Environments:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

4. Export consolidated dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip freeze > requirements-frozen.txt
   ```

UV offers faster installation times, better dependency resolution, and is 100% compatible with pip. For more information, visit the [UV documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
