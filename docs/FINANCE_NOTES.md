## **Common Financial Ratios & Margins:**

1.  **Current Ratio:**
    *   **Calculation:** `Current Assets / Current Liabilities`
    *   **What it shows:** A measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term debts (those due within a year) using its short-term assets (cash, receivables, inventory, etc.).
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   Ratio > 1: Generally suggests the company has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
        *   Ratio < 1: Could indicate potential difficulty meeting short-term obligations.
        *   *Context matters:* What's "good" varies by industry.

2.  **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E):**
    *   **Calculation:** `Total Liabilities / Total Stockholders' Equity`
    *   **What it shows:** How much debt a company is using to finance its assets compared to the value of shareholders' equity. It measures financial leverage.
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   Higher ratio: Means the company relies more on debt (higher leverage, potentially higher risk but also potential for higher returns if things go well).
        *   Lower ratio: Means the company relies more on equity financing (lower leverage, potentially lower risk).
        *   *Context matters:* Acceptable levels vary significantly by industry.

3.  **Gross Profit Margin:**
    *   **Calculation:** `(Revenue - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue` or `Gross Profit / Revenue` (expressed as a percentage)
    *   **What it shows:** How efficiently a company produces its goods or services. It's the percentage of revenue left after paying the direct costs of production.
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   Higher percentage: Better efficiency in production, more money left over to cover operating expenses and generate profit.
        *   Lower percentage: Less efficient production or lower pricing power.

4.  **Operating Profit Margin (or Operating Margin):**
    *   **Calculation:** `Operating Income (or Loss) / Revenue` (expressed as a percentage)
    *   **What it shows:** How much profit a company makes from its core business operations *before* interest and taxes. It reflects the profitability of the ongoing business itself.
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   Higher percentage: Better operational efficiency and profitability from core activities.

5.  **Net Profit Margin:**
    *   **Calculation:** `Net Income (or Loss) / Revenue` (expressed as a percentage)
    *   **What it shows:** The "bottom line" profitability. It's the percentage of revenue remaining as profit after *all* expenses (including COGS, operating expenses, interest, and taxes) have been paid.
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   Higher percentage: More profit generated per dollar of revenue.
