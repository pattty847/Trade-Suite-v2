You've built a sophisticated and well-structured system with `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`, `trade_suite/gui/task_manager.py`, and `trade_suite/gui/signals.py` as its core. Your goal to make these components streamlined, less dependent, and easily usable for various purposes (UI, servers like `mcp_server.py`, scripts, tests) is excellent.

Let's break down your current setup and discuss potential enhancements:

**Overall Assessment of Your Current Setup:**

Your current architecture has many strengths:

*   **Modularity:** `Data`, `TaskManager`, and `SignalEmitter` are distinct components with reasonably clear responsibilities.
*   **Asynchronous Design:** The core operations are `async`, which is ideal for I/O-bound tasks like fetching data from exchanges.
*   **Dependency Injection:**
    *   `Data` receives `influx` and `emitter` instances.
    *   `TaskManager` receives a `Data` instance.
    This is a great practice, enhancing testability and flexibility, as demonstrated by how you use dummy components in `mcp_server.py`.
*   **Decoupled Communication (`SignalEmitter`):**
    *   This provides an effective publish-subscribe mechanism, allowing components to communicate without direct dependencies. This is especially useful for UI updates.
    *   The thread-safe emission (`emit_threadsafe`) and payload pooling are thoughtful additions.
*   **Flexible Data Streams in `Data`:**
    *   Methods like `watch_trades` and `watch_orderbook` in `data_source.py` accept `sink` and `queue` parameters. This is a significant advantage, as it allows these methods to be used in contexts where the full `SignalEmitter` and its processing loop might be overhead or not desired (e.g., simple scripts, backend processing).
*   **Lifecycle Management (`TaskManager`):**
    *   The reference counting (`stream_ref_counts`, `factory_ref_counts`) and widget subscription model (`widget_subscriptions`) are well-suited for managing data streams based on the needs of UI components.
    *   The handling of `asyncio.Event` for stopping streams is correct.

**Is your current setup good?**
Yes, it's a robust and well-thought-out setup. You've incorporated several good design patterns.

**Could it be better? More streamlined? Less dependent on one another but still works flawlessly together?**
Yes, there are always opportunities for refinement. Here are some areas and suggestions:

**1. Streamlining `TaskManager`'s Interaction with `Data` for Starting Streams:**

*   **Current Situation:** In `TaskManager.subscribe`, you have logic like:
    ```python
    if key.startswith("trades_"):
        _, exchange, symbol = key.split("_", 2)
        coro = self._get_watch_trades_coro(exchange, symbol, stop_event) 
        # which internally calls self.data.watch_trades(...)
    elif key.startswith("orderbook_"):
        # ... calls self.data.watch_orderbook(...)
    ```
    This means `TaskManager` has explicit knowledge of the naming convention of `Data`'s `watch_*` methods and how to parse keys to call them.

*   **Suggestion for Decoupling:**
    Introduce a more abstract contract for requesting data streams.
    *   `Data` could expose a method like `get_data_stream_coroutine(stream_request: dict, stop_event: asyncio.Event, **kwargs)`.
    *   The `stream_request` dictionary would carry the specifics, e.g., `{'type': 'trades', 'exchange': 'binance', 'symbol': 'BTC/USDT'}` or `{'type': 'orderbook', ...}`.
    *   `TaskManager` would construct this `stream_request` based on widget requirements and call this generic method. `Data` would then internally dispatch to the appropriate `watch_trades`, `watch_orderbook`, etc.
    *   The `kwargs` could pass through optional `sink` or `queue` if `TaskManager` needs to support those for certain stream types directly (though typically, for UI, signals are preferred).

*   **Benefit:** `TaskManager` becomes less coupled to the specific `watch_*` method names and signatures in `Data`. `Data` can evolve its internal stream-providing methods more freely.

**2. The `Data.set_ui_loop()` Mechanism:**

*   **Current Situation:** `TaskManager` provides its asyncio loop to `Data` via `set_ui_loop()`. This allows `Data` (through `SignalEmitter.emit_threadsafe`) to schedule signal emissions directly onto the UI/main thread's loop, bypassing the emitter's internal queue for better performance.
*   **Assessment:** This is a pragmatic optimization. The fallback mechanism (emitter using its queue if `emit_threadsafe` isn't used with a loop, or if called from the target loop already) is good.
*   **Consideration:** For non-UI contexts (like your `mcp_server.py` or standalone scripts), `set_ui_loop` would typically not be called.
    *   If these contexts use a `SignalEmitter` and want to process signals, they'd need to call `SignalEmitter.process_signal_queue()` periodically in their main loop.
    *   Alternatively, as mentioned before, the `sink`/`queue` parameters in `Data`'s `watch_*` methods offer a way to get data without relying on the `SignalEmitter` at all, which is excellent for these scenarios.

**3. Using `Data` and `TaskManager` in Ad-hoc Scripts/Servers:**

*   **`Data` Component:** Your `Data` class is already quite versatile for standalone use, especially because its `watch_*` methods can output to `sink` functions or `asyncio.Queue`s. This largely decouples it from needing a full `SignalEmitter` or `TaskManager` if direct data handling is preferred. The `mcp_server.py` initializing `Data` with dummy `InfluxDB` and `SignalEmitter` is a perfect example of its adaptability.
*   **`TaskManager` Component:**
    *   If an ad-hoc script needs to manage multiple complex data streams with reference counting (similar to the UI), `TaskManager` could be used. Its subscription model is generic enough (widget IDs can be any unique identifier).
    *   The main challenge would be ensuring that any UI-specific parts of `TaskManager` (like `create_loading_modal`) have non-GUI fallbacks (which `run_task_with_loading_popup` seems to have with `print`).
    *   For simple cases of running one or two streams, directly using `Data` methods with `asyncio.create_task` and managing `stop_event`s might be simpler than involving the full `TaskManager`.

**Example: Using `Data` in a Standalone Script (Illustrates its flexibility):**

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from trade_suite.data.data_source import Data
# Assuming dummy or no-op InfluxDB and SignalEmitter for simplicity
from trade_suite.data.influx import InfluxDB # Or your dummy
from trade_suite.gui.signals import SignalEmitter # Or your dummy

# --- Dummy implementations if not using real ones ---
class DummyInflux(InfluxDB): 
    async def connect(self): pass
    async def close(self): pass
    # Implement other methods as no-ops if Data calls them
    async def write_trades(self, exchange_id, trades): logging.debug("DummyInflux: write_trades called")
    async def write_stats(self, exchange_id, stats, symbol): logging.debug("DummyInflux: write_stats called")


class DummyEmitter(SignalEmitter):
    def emit(self, signal, *args, **kwargs): logging.debug(f"DummyEmitter: {signal} emitted")
    def emit_threadsafe(self, loop, signal, *args, **kwargs): logging.debug(f"DummyEmitter: {signal} emitted (threadsafe)")

async def my_custom_trade_handler(trade_event_dict: dict):
    # {'exchange': exchange, 'trade_data': trade_data}
    logging.info(f"Script received trade on {trade_event_dict['exchange']}: {trade_event_dict['trade_data']}")

async def main_script():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    
    # Use dummy or actual implementations as needed
    # For this example, let's assume 'binance' is a valid exchange CCXT can access publicly
    data_service = Data(influx=DummyInflux(None), emitter=DummyEmitter(), exchanges=["binance"], force_public=True)
    # data_service.set_ui_loop(asyncio.get_event_loop()) # Not strictly needed if not relying on emit_threadsafe optimization to a specific 'UI' loop
    
    stop_event = asyncio.Event()
    exchange_id = "binance" # Make sure this exchange is initialized in Data
    symbol = "BTC/USDT"     # A common symbol

    if exchange_id not in data_service.exchange_list:
        logging.error(f"Exchange {exchange_id} not available in data_service. Available: {list(data_service.exchange_list.keys())}")
        return

    logging.info(f"Starting trade watch for {symbol} on {exchange_id} using a direct sink...")
    
    watch_task = asyncio.create_task(
        data_service.watch_trades(
            symbol=symbol,
            exchange=exchange_id,
            stop_event=stop_event,
            track_stats=False, # Keep it simple for the example
            write_trades=False,
            sink=my_custom_trade_handler 
        )
    )

    try:
        await asyncio.sleep(30) # Run for 30 seconds
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logging.info("Keyboard interrupt received.")
    finally:
        logging.info("Stopping trade watch...")
        stop_event.set()
        await watch_task # Wait for the task to acknowledge stop and finish
        logging.info("Trade watch stopped.")
        await data_service.close_all_exchanges() # Important for ccxt

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main_script())
```

**Your Note on `CandleFactory`:**
Your thought ("`CandleFactory`... we just use one factory per timeframe and it works but we could do all in one class and store in a dict...") is a valid consideration for future refactoring of `CandleFactory` itself. It relates to how candle data is managed and processed rather than the fundamental interaction mechanics of `Data`, `TaskManager`, and `Signals`. Keeping it as a note for later is a good approach.

**Summary of Recommendations:**

1.  **Maintain Core Strengths:** Keep the dependency injection, the `SignalEmitter` pattern, and the flexible `sink`/`queue` options in `Data`'s streaming methods.
2.  **Abstract Stream Initiation:** Consider refining the interface between `TaskManager` and `Data` for requesting streams to be more dictionary-based or capability-based, rather than `TaskManager` parsing string keys to call specific `data.watch_*` methods. This is the most impactful change for further decoupling.
3.  **Leverage `sink`/`queue` for Non-UI Use:** For scripts and backend services (like potentially more advanced versions of `mcp_server.py`), actively use the `sink` and `queue` parameters of `Data`'s `watch_*` methods to avoid the overhead or complexity of `SignalEmitter` where direct data handling is more appropriate.

Your project is on a very solid footing. The desire for continuous improvement and cleaner abstractions is key to maintaining a large and evolving codebase. The suggestions above are aimed at enhancing the already good design you have in place.
