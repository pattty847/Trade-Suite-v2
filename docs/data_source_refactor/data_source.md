Okay, this is a fantastic and detailed breakdown of the remaining areas for improvement! It gives us a clear roadmap.

You asked for a refresher on the `stop_event` and how it works, especially with the recommended changes. Let's cover that first, and then we can lay out a phased plan based on your new document.

**Understanding `asyncio.Event` and the `stop_event` (Refresher + Recommended Logic)**

At its core, the `stop_event` instances used in your project are objects of `asyncio.Event`. Think of an `asyncio.Event` as a signaling flag between asynchronous tasks:

1.  **States:** It has an internal boolean flag.
    *   **Cleared (False):** This is the default state when an `Event` is created. It generally means "continue" or "not signaled yet."
    *   **Set (True):** The flag is explicitly changed to true. It generally means "signaled" or "stop."

2.  **Key Methods:**
    *   `event = asyncio.Event()`: Creates a new event, initially in the "cleared" state.
    *   `event.set()`: Sets the internal flag to `True`. Any tasks waiting for the event to be set will wake up.
    *   `event.clear()`: Resets the internal flag to `False`.
    *   `event.is_set()`: Returns `True` if the flag is set, `False` if it's cleared.
    *   `await event.wait()`: An `async` function can pause its execution here until another part of the code calls `event.set()`.

**How `stop_event` *Should* Work in Your Project (The Recommended Fix):**

*   **Watcher Loops in `data_source.py`:**
    Methods like `watch_trades`, `watch_orderbook`, etc., will continue to use:
    ```python
    while not stop_event.is_set():
        # ... keep fetching data and emitting ...
    logging.info(f"Stream for {symbol} on {exchange} stopped.")
    ```
    This loop runs as long as `stop_event.is_set()` is `False` (i.e., the event is "cleared"). When `stop_event.set()` is called elsewhere, `is_set()` becomes `True`, `not stop_event.is_set()` becomes `False`, and the loop terminates gracefully after its current iteration.

*   **`TaskManager` in `task_manager.py`:**
    1.  **Subscription (`subscribe`)**:
        *   When a new stream is needed (first subscriber), `TaskManager` will create a new `asyncio.Event()`: `stop_event = asyncio.Event()`.
        *   **Crucially, it will NOT call `stop_event.set()` here.** The event will be passed to the `watch_` coroutine in its default "cleared" state.
        *   This means the `while not stop_event.is_set():` loop in `data_source.py` will start immediately.
    2.  **Unsubscription (`unsubscribe`)**:
        *   When the last subscriber for a stream is gone, `TaskManager` will retrieve the `stop_event` associated with that stream.
        *   It will then call `stop_event.set()`. This signals the corresponding `watch_` loop in `data_source.py` to terminate.
        *   After setting the event, `TaskManager` can then `task.cancel()` the asyncio task as a final cleanup, ensuring it doesn't hang if it was stuck on an `await` call for reasons other than the event.
    3.  **Removing `stop_event.clear()` from `data_source.py`**:
        *   The lines `stop_event.clear()` at the beginning of `watch_trades` and `watch_orderbook` in `data_source.py` will be **removed**. They are no longer needed because `TaskManager` will provide the event in the correct initial "cleared" state.
    4.  **`TaskManager.is_stream_running`**:
        *   To correctly reflect that a stream is active when its `stop_event` has *not* been set (i.e., it hasn't been told to stop), this method should check `return task_running and not event.is_set()`.

This approach makes the signaling direct and intuitive: `set()` means stop, `cleared` means run.

**Refactoring Plan: Phased Approach**

Let's structure the work based on your document.

**Phase 1: Logic, Correctness, and Quick Wins**

This phase focuses on the immediate fixes from sections "1 | Logic & correctness" and "4 | One-liners worth committing tonight" of your new plan.

*   **Task 1.0: Implement Cache Write Lock (Foundation for safe CSV ops)**
    *   **File:** `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`
    *   In `Data.__init__`, add `self.cache_locks: Dict[str, asyncio.Lock] = {}`.
    *   In `fetch_and_process_candles`, before any operations involving a specific cache file (identified by `key`):
        *   Get or create an `asyncio.Lock` for this `key`:
            ```python
            if key not in self.cache_locks:
                self.cache_locks[key] = asyncio.Lock()
            cache_lock = self.cache_locks[key]
            ```
        *   Wrap the entire body of `fetch_and_process_candles` (after lock retrieval) in `async with cache_lock:`. This ensures that all loading, processing, and saving for a given cache key are serialized.

*   **Task 1.1: Implement "The Recommended Fix for `stop_event` Logic"** (as detailed above)
    *   **Files:** `trade_suite/gui/task_manager.py`, `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`
    *   `task_manager.py`:
        *   `subscribe()`: Remove `stop_event.set()` after creating the event.
        *   `unsubscribe()`: Call `stop_event.set()` *before* `self.stop_task(key)`.
        *   `is_stream_running()`: Change logic to `return task_running and event and not event.is_set()`.
    *   `data_source.py`:
        *   Remove `stop_event.clear()` from the start of `watch_trades()` and `watch_orderbook()`.

*   **Task 1.2: Separate Metadata from OHLCV CSVs** (Issue 1.2 from your plan)
    *   **File:** `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`
    *   Modify `_save_cache()`:
        *   OHLCV data (the current `df_to_save` columns: `dates`, `opens`, `highs`, `lows`, `closes`, `volumes`) goes into `key.csv`.
        *   Metadata (`exchange`, `symbol`, `timeframe`) goes into a new `key.meta.json` file.
        *   Example for JSON:
            ```python
            meta_path = path.replace(".csv", ".meta.json")
            metadata_to_save = {'exchange': exchange_id, 'symbol': symbol, 'timeframe': timeframe}
            # Use asyncio.to_thread for writing this json file (see Task 1.5)
            ```
    *   Modify `_load_cache()`:
        *   It should now only load and expect columns from the pure OHLCV `key.csv`.
        *   The metadata (if needed by the caller of `_load_cache` or subsequent processing) would have to be loaded separately from `key.meta.json`. For now, `_load_cache`'s responsibility simplifies to just loading the OHLCV DataFrame.

*   **Task 1.3: Correct Rate Limit Back-off Scope** (Issue 1.3 & One-liner #1)
    *   **File:** `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`
    *   In `retry_fetch_ohlcv()`:
        *   The `async with semaphore:` block should *only* wrap the `ohlcv = await exchange.fetch_ohlcv(...)` call.
        *   The `await asyncio.sleep(...)` for `RateLimitExceeded` and other error handling/retries should occur *outside* this semaphore context to free up the semaphore slot while sleeping.
        ```python
        # Corrected structure sketch:
        while num_retries < max_retries:
            try:
                async with semaphore:
                    ohlcv = await exchange.fetch_ohlcv(...)
                return ohlcv # Successful fetch
            except ccxt.RateLimitExceeded as e:
                # ... logging ...
                # Sleep OUTSIDE the semaphore context
                await asyncio.sleep(exchange.rateLimit / 1000 * (2 ** num_retries))
            except ccxt.NetworkError as e:
                # ... logging ...
                await asyncio.sleep(1 * (2 ** num_retries)) # Sleep OUTSIDE semaphore
            # ... other exceptions ...
        ```

*   **Task 1.4: Prevent Duplicate Last Candle Loop** (Issue 1.4 & One-liner #2)
    *   **File:** `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`
    *   In `_fetch_candle_data_after_timestamp()`:
        *   Before updating `current_loop_fetch_timestamp` inside the `if ohlcv_batch:` block, store its current value: `previous_loop_fetch_timestamp = current_loop_fetch_timestamp`.
        *   After `current_loop_fetch_timestamp = ohlcv_batch[-1][0] + timeframe_duration_ms`, add the check:
            ```python
            if ohlcv_batch[-1][0] <= previous_loop_fetch_timestamp:
                logging.warning(f"Last candle in batch timestamp {ohlcv_batch[-1][0]} is not newer than previous fetch timestamp {previous_loop_fetch_timestamp} for {exchange.id} {symbol} {timeframe}. Breaking fetch to prevent loop.")
                break
            ```

*   **Task 1.5: Implement Non-Blocking File I/O** (Issue 1.5 & One-liner #3)
    *   **File:** `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`
    *   In `_save_cache()`:
        *   For CSV: `await asyncio.to_thread(df_to_save[columns_to_save].to_csv, path, index=False)`
        *   For `key.meta.json` (from Task 1.2):
            ```python
            import json # at top of file
            # ...
            meta_path = path.replace(".csv", ".meta.json") # Assuming path is for .csv
            metadata_content = {'exchange': exchange_id, 'symbol': symbol, 'timeframe': timeframe}
            
            def write_json():
                with open(meta_path, 'w') as f:
                    json.dump(metadata_content, f, indent=4)
            await asyncio.to_thread(write_json)
            ```
    *   Consider `_load_cache()`: `pd.read_csv()` is also blocking.
        *   Change to: `await asyncio.to_thread(pd.read_csv, path, dtype={"dates": "Int64"})`
        *   Similarly for loading `key.meta.json` if/when that's added to `_load_cache`.

*   **Task 1.6: Safe Semaphore Initialization** (Issue 3 from "Traps" & One-liner #4)
    *   **File:** `trade_suite/data/data_source.py`
    *   In `retry_fetch_ohlcv()`: Ensure semaphore initialization is safe.
        ```python
        # Current code:
        # if exchange.id not in self.exchange_semaphores:
        #     logging.warning(...)
        #     self.exchange_semaphores[exchange.id] = asyncio.Semaphore(5) 
        # semaphore = self.exchange_semaphores[exchange.id]

        # Change to:
        semaphore = self.exchange_semaphores.setdefault(exchange.id, asyncio.Semaphore(5))
        if semaphore.locked() and len(self.exchange_semaphores[exchange.id]._waiters if hasattr(self.exchange_semaphores[exchange.id], '_waiters') else []) == 0 : # A bit of a heuristic if it's newly created by setdefault
             logging.debug(f"Semaphore for {exchange.id} initialized by setdefault or already existed.")

        ```
        The primary initialization is in `fetch_candles`. The `retry_fetch_ohlcv` one is a fallback. `setdefault` is the correct way to handle this.

This Phase 1 is quite packed but addresses many critical correctness and performance points.

How does this look for a start? We can then detail Phase 2 (Class Extraction & Design Improvements) and Phase 3 (Further Refinements, Testing, Profiling) once these are tackled.


The user wants to append Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the refactoring plan to the docs/data_source_refactor/data_source.md file. I need to generate the content for these phases based on the GPT-3 feedback provided earlier and the discussion we've had. The content should be detailed enough for a fresh context window.
Phase 2 Plan (Design Smell & Class Extraction):
  Task 2.0: Generic Watcher Function
  Problem: Duplicate watch_trades vs watch_trades_list, watch_orderbook vs watch_orderbook_list.
  Solution: Create a generic async def _watch_stream(self, ccxt_watch_method: Callable, on_message_callback: Callable, stream_identifier: str, stop_event: asyncio.Event, symbol_or_symbols: Union[str, List[str]], exchange_id: str)
  ccxt_watch_method: e.g., exchange_object.watchTradesForSymbols or exchange_object.watch_trades.
  on_message_callback: A function to call with (exchange_id, data). This callback would handle signal emission or other processing.
  stream_identifier: For logging, e.g., "Trades" or "Orderbook".
  symbol_or_symbols: The symbol(s) argument for the CCXT method.
  The loop will be while not stop_event.is_set(): with try/except for asyncio.CancelledError and other exceptions.
  Refactor existing watcher methods (watch_trades, watch_orderbook, watch_trades_list, watch_orderbooks) to use this generic function, passing the appropriate CCXT method and a specific on_message_callback that emits the correct signal (e.g., Signals.NEW_TRADE or Signals.ORDER_BOOK_UPDATE).
  This addresses "2. Duplicate watch loops" from the plan.
  Task 2.1: Decouple Emitter from Fetching/Streaming (Address "Emitter coupling")
  Modify watcher callbacks (from Task 2.0) and candle fetching logic: Instead of directly calling self.emitter.emit_threadsafe or self.emitter.emit, these functions should return the fetched/received data.
  The TaskManager or another higher-level component that calls these data methods will be responsible for emitting signals to the GUI.
  This promotes SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and makes the Data class (or its future refactored parts) more testable and usable in non-GUI contexts.
  For example, _process_trade_data(exchange_id, trades) would return (exchange_id, trades[0]), and TaskManager would emit it.
  Task 2.2: Plan for Data Class Decomposition (Address "God-class")
  This is a larger architectural change. For this phase, the goal is to outline the new classes and their primary responsibilities, preparing for actual implementation in a later phase or iteration.
  CacheStore (or CandleCache):
  Responsibilities: Loading OHLCV data from CSV/JSON, saving OHLCV data to CSV/JSON, managing metadata (from .meta.json files), handling cache prepending/appending logic.
  Methods: _load_cache, _save_cache, _prepend_historic_candles (or parts of it related to DataFrame manipulation after fetching). It would take file paths and dataframes as input.
  It should use non-blocking file I/O (asyncio.to_thread).
  CandleFetcher (or ExchangeClient):
  Responsibilities: All CCXT interactions for fetching OHLCV data (fetch_ohlcv), managing per-exchange semaphores, retry logic (retry_fetch_ohlcv), generating cache keys.
  It would interact with CacheStore to get cached data and to provide new data to be cached.
  It would not know about GUI signals or InfluxDB. It returns raw data.
  Streamer (or DataStreamer):
  Responsibilities: Managing live data streams from exchanges (trades, order books) using the generic _watch_stream (from Task 2.0).
  It would use CCXT methods for watching streams.
  Like CandleFetcher, it should return raw data rather than emitting signals directly.
  DataFacade (or DataSourceService):
  The current Data class will evolve into this, or this will be a new class that orchestrates the others.
  It will hold instances of CacheStore, CandleFetcher, and Streamer.
  It will expose the public API currently on Data (e.g., fetch_candles, watch_trades, etc.) but will delegate the work to the specialized classes.
  This facade will be responsible for integrating with InfluxDB (passing data to it) and for providing data to the TaskManager (which then handles GUI signal emission).
  It will also manage the cache_locks.
Phase 3 Plan (Refinement, Testing, and Advanced Issues):
  Task 3.0: Implement Data Class Decomposition
  Based on the plan from Task 2.2, actually create the new classes (CacheStore, CandleFetcher, Streamer) and refactor the Data class (or create DataFacade) to use them.
  This will involve moving methods and adjusting call sites.
  Ensure clear separation of concerns.
  Task 3.1: Unit Testing
  File: Create new test files in a tests/ directory (e.g., tests/data/test_candle_fetcher.py, tests/data/test_cache_store.py).
  Focus on:
  CacheStore: Test loading from non-existent files, loading malformed files, saving, and then loading to verify data integrity. Test prepend logic with mock data.
  CandleFetcher:
  Mock exchange.fetch_ohlcv to test retry logic for RateLimitExceeded and NetworkError.
  Test the "duplicate last candle" edge case (mock CCXT returning a constant batch for a few calls).
  Test first-candle fallback logic.
  Generic _watch_stream: Test with a mock ccxt_watch_method that yields a few items then raises CancelledError or another exception.
  Use pytest and pytest-asyncio. Use unittest.mock for mocking CCXT calls.
  Task 3.2: Profiling and Performance Optimization
  Run the application with a significant load as suggested: 8 symbols × 3 timeframes × 2 exchanges.
  Use py-spy top --gil --native --loop-event-threads --idle --nonblocking to profile the running asyncio application.
  Identify any remaining blocking calls, especially pandas operations or unexpected I/O.
  Investigate the impact of DEBUG level logging on performance (as per call-out question). If it's significant, ensure it's easy to toggle or selectively enable.
  Task 3.3: Address Call-out Questions & Final Review
  Per-row OHLCV logging at DEBUG: Review the necessity. If retry_fetch_ohlcv logs batch fetches and errors sufficiently, the very verbose per-candle logging inside loops might be removable or further reduced. This is more of a DEBUG-level concern for development, but it's good to be mindful of log volume.
  Downstream code relying on metadata columns in DataFrame: If key.meta.json is implemented (Task 1.2), ensure that any code that was expecting exchange, symbol, timeframe directly in the DataFrame from all_candles (in Data.fetch_candles's result) is updated. This might involve TaskManager or GUI components. The goal is to have all_candles contain DataFrames of pure OHLCV data.
  Review overall architecture after class decomposition.
  Update docstrings for new classes and methods, removing any remaining "Trelent" noise and ensuring clarity.
This looks like a solid plan. I'll now generate the markdown content for phases 2 and 3.
Okay, I've appended the detailed plans for Phase 2 and Phase 3 to your docs/data_source_refactor/data_source.md file. This should provide a good, detailed roadmap for future sessions, even with a fresh context.
Here's a summary of what was added for those phases:
Phase 2: Design Smell & Class Extraction
This phase focuses on improving the internal design of the Data class by creating a generic watcher function to reduce duplication and by planning the decomposition of the Data class into more focused components. It also emphasizes decoupling GUI signal emissions from data fetching/streaming logic.
Task 2.0: Generic Watcher Function: Create a reusable _watch_stream helper to consolidate the logic of the various watch_* methods.
Task 2.1: Decouple Emitter from Fetching/Streaming: Modify data fetching and streaming methods to return data, making higher-level components (like TaskManager) responsible for GUI signal emissions.
Task 2.2: Plan for Data Class Decomposition: Outline the responsibilities and interactions of new proposed classes: CacheStore (for cache I/O), CandleFetcher (for CCXT interactions and fetching OHLCV), Streamer (for live data streams), and DataFacade (to orchestrate these components and replace the current monolith).
Phase 3: Refinement, Testing, and Advanced Issues
This phase involves implementing the class decomposition planned in Phase 2, writing comprehensive unit tests, profiling for performance, and addressing any remaining advanced issues or call-out questions from the feedback.
Task 3.0: Implement Data Class Decomposition: Carry out the actual refactoring by creating the new classes and modifying the Data class (or creating DataFacade).
Task 3.1: Unit Testing: Write pytest unit tests for the new components, covering cache operations, fetching logic (including retries and edge cases like duplicate candles), and the generic watcher.
Task 3.2: Profiling and Performance Optimization: Use tools like py-spy to identify and address any remaining performance bottlenecks under load.
Task 3.3: Address Call-out Questions & Final Review: Revisit questions about logging verbosity and the use of metadata columns in DataFrames. Conduct a final review of the architecture and docstrings.
I'll now apply this to the markdown file.
