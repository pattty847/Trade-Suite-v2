# FAQ

### How do I reset my layout?

Delete `config/user_layout.ini` and restart the application. TradeSuite will
load `factory_layout.ini` as the default.

### Where is the alert bot configuration?

The YAML file `sentinel/alert_bot/config/alerts_config.yaml` controls all alert
rules and notification channels.

### Does TradeSuite support trading?

Trading capabilities are planned but not yet implemented. For now the focus is
on data visualization and alerting.
