**Refactoring Goals:**

1.  **Clearer Initialization State:** Make it more obvious to the calling code whether an exchange loaded successfully or failed, and why.
2.  **Robust Error Handling During Load:** Ensure errors are caught, logged comprehensively, and don't stop other exchanges from attempting to load.
3.  **Single Source of Truth for Exchange Objects:** Simplify internal state management for loaded exchanges.
4.  **Maintain `force_public`:** This proved useful.
5.  **Generality for Exchanges:** Ensure the design isn't overly tied to Coinbase specifics beyond what `ccxt` itself handles.

**Proposed Changes for `CCXTInterface`:**

1.  **Modified `__init__`:**
    *   `self.exchange_list: Dict[str, ccxtpro.Exchange] = {}` (Corrected type hint for successfully loaded exchanges)
    *   `self.failed_exchanges: Dict[str, str] = {}` (To store exchange_id and a reason string for failures)

2.  **Rename `load_exchange` to `_create_and_load_exchange` (Internal Helper):**
    *   This method will contain the actual logic to instantiate, call `load_markets()`, and check features for a *single* exchange.
    *   If successful, it returns the `ccxtpro.Exchange` instance.
    *   If there's any failure (exception during load, or feature check fails), it will:
        *   Log the error comprehensively (using `logging.error(..., exc_info=True)` for exceptions).
        *   Store the failure reason in `self.failed_exchanges[exchange_id] = "reason string"`.
        *   Return `None`.

3.  **New Public `load_exchange(self, exchange_id: str)` Method:**
    *   This will be the public method to load a single exchange on demand.
    *   It first checks if the `exchange_id` is already in `self.exchange_list` (return it) or `self.failed_exchanges` (log warning, return `None`).
    *   If not previously attempted/failed, it calls `await self._create_and_load_exchange(exchange_id)`.
    *   If successful, it adds the instance to `self.exchange_list`, removes it from `self.failed_exchanges` (if it was there from a *previous* failed attempt), logs success, and returns the instance.
    *   If `_create_and_load_exchange` returns `None`, this method also returns `None`.

4.  **Revised `load_exchanges(self, exchanges: List[str] = None)` Method:**
    *   This method will iterate through the list of exchanges to load.
    *   For each `exchange_id`, it will call `await self.load_exchange(exchange_id)`.
    *   After attempting to load all specified exchanges, it will log a summary (e.g., "Loaded X exchanges, Y failed. Failed: {self.failed_exchanges}").
    *   It will not return any direct list of successes/failures, as this state is now stored in `self.exchange_list` and `self.failed_exchanges`. Callers can inspect these attributes.

5.  **Removal of `self._instances`:** The combination of `self.exchange_list` (for successes) and `self.failed_exchanges` makes `self._instances` redundant.

**Impact on `Data` Class:**
*   No direct changes needed in `Data` itself due to these `CCXTInterface` refactorings, as it inherits the loading mechanism.
*   Code using the `Data` object (like your `Viewport` or `download_candles.py`) will now have access to `data.exchange_list` and `data.failed_exchanges` to make more informed decisions if an exchange critical to its operation failed to load.


The `CCXTInterface` class has been refactored with the following changes:

1.  **State Management:**
    *   Removed `_instances`.
    *   `self.exchange_list: Dict[str, ccxtpro.Exchange]` now stores successfully initialized exchange objects.
    *   `self.failed_exchanges: Dict[str, str]` stores the ID and error reason for exchanges that failed to load.
    *   `self.exchanges` was renamed to `self.target_exchanges` in `__init__` to clarify it's the list of exchanges *to be loaded*, not the currently loaded ones.

2.  **Loading Logic:**
    *   A new internal method `_create_and_load_exchange(exchange_id)` handles the actual instantiation, market loading, and feature checking for a single exchange. It updates `self.failed_exchanges` upon failure and logs detailed errors.
    *   The public `load_exchange(exchange_id)` now uses `_create_and_load_exchange`. It checks for already loaded/failed states, attempts loading, and updates `self.exchange_list` and `self.failed_exchanges` accordingly. It allows retrying a previously failed exchange.
    *   `load_exchanges()` iterates through target exchanges, calls `self.load_exchange()` for each, and then logs a summary of successful and failed loads.

3.  **Credential Handling (`_get_credentials`):**
    *   Slightly improved logging messages.
    *   Added a check for placeholder API key/secret values.
    *   Now also looks for and includes `<EXCHANGE>_PASSWORD` if present, as some exchanges use this.
    *   Return type annotation changed to `Dict[str, str]` as it always returns a dictionary (empty if no valid credentials).

4.  **Closing Exchanges (`close_all_exchanges`):**
    *   Iterates `self.exchange_list`.
    *   Improved logging and error handling within the closing tasks for individual exchanges.

These changes should make the exchange loading process more robust, provide better diagnostics when things go wrong, and make the state of loaded exchanges clearer to the rest of your application.

Your `Data` class, inheriting from this, will automatically benefit. The main difference for the consuming code (like your GUI) is that it can now check `data.exchange_list` for available exchanges and `data.failed_exchanges` for issues, allowing for more graceful error handling or user feedback if a required exchange isn't available.

For example, in your GUI widgets, before trying `data.exchange_list[exchange_name]`, you could first check `if exchange_name in data.exchange_list:`.

**Post-Refactoring Notes:**

*   **UI Impact & Resolution:** This refactoring initially led to a UI loading failure. The `trade_suite/gui/viewport.py` module was attempting to access `data.exchanges`, which had been effectively replaced by `data.exchange_list` (a dictionary of loaded exchange objects). The issue was resolved by updating `viewport.py` (specifically the `populate_exchange_menu` method) to correctly use `data.exchange_list.keys()` for populating UI elements. This highlights the importance of checking downstream dependencies after significant refactoring of core data interfaces.
