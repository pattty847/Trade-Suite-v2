# Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds. The basics are as follows:

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. **Follow the style guidelines** outlined in `AGENTS.md` and
   `docs/developer_guide/style_guide.md`.
3. **Make atomic commits** with clear messages. Reference issues where
   applicable.
4. **Open a pull request** targeting the `main` branch.

Please read `AGENTS.md` in the project root for additional details about commit
formatting, testing expectations and development conventions.
