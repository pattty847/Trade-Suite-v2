🎉  Glad the changes made an immediate difference!

Below is a short, prioritised “next-up” list based on the code-review notes and what we just learned while tuning the chart path.  Most of these are low-risk, high-impact tweaks you can slot in incrementally.

──────────────────────────────────
1. Order-Book Pipeline
──────────────────────────────────
A. OrderBookProcessor  
• Already uses NumPy, but it still converts the raw `bids` / `asks` lists to two new arrays on every update.  
 → Keep two pre-allocated buffers and fill them in-place (`np.resize` / slicing) when level counts vary.  
 → When aggregation state hasn’t changed, skip re-sorting: bids come in price-DESC, asks price-ASC—both already monotonic.

• Spread filter: build a slice index with `np.searchsorted` instead of boolean masks.

B. OrderBookWidget  
• You now push **all** (x,y) arrays into `dpg.set_value` every tick.  
 → Keep references returned by `dpg.add_*_series`, then only update the *tail* chunk that changed (`dpg.set_value_part`), same trick as chart.  
• If aggregation flag is OFF, render depth only every N frames (checkbox “full book realtime”). Users rarely need millisecond resolution of the entire ladder.

──────────────────────────────────
2. PriceLevelWidget table
──────────────────────────────────
• `_aggregate_order_book` currently builds Python `dict`s each update.  
 → Port that to NumPy like the processor; you’ll gain ~5–8× speed.

• Row update loop: batch-update values with `dpg.set_table_row` (will land in 1.11) or cache tags in two flat lists, then use `dpg.set_values` to update *columns* with single C-calls.

• Consider pushing actual rendering to another thread (DPG is thread-safe if you guard with `dpg.lock_mutex()` / `unlock_mutex()`) so heavy  depth merges don’t block the GUI thread.

──────────────────────────────────
3. TaskManager & SignalEmitter
──────────────────────────────────
• Replace the `asyncio.Queue` consumer with `loop.call_soon_threadsafe(emitter.emit, …)` directly from the worker tasks. Eliminates a busy-wait coroutine.  

• Introduce a **Signal object pool** (fixed deque) to recycle dicts/tuples and reduce GC churn.

──────────────────────────────────
4. CandleFactory follow-ups
──────────────────────────────────
• Swap Pandas DF for a fixed-size NumPy structured array or PyArrow table. Pandas is still handy for resample, but for realtime append it’s over-kill.

• Push initial history to GPU-compressed Parquet (via `pyarrow`) to slash loading times at start-up.

──────────────────────────────────
5. Backend / CCXT
──────────────────────────────────
• If an exchange supports websocket **diff** order-book streams (`depthUpdate`, `l2Updates`) subscribe to them instead of periodic full snapshots; feed the diff straight into the processor.  

## Coinbase Order Book Feeds: How CCXT Utilizes Snapshots and Differential Updates

Coinbase's Advanced Trade platform provides order book data through websocket feeds, offering initial full snapshots followed by differential updates. This method, used by CCXT's `watch_order_book` function, efficiently maintains a local order book by processing only the changes in price levels. The `level2` channel in Coinbase's API ensures reliable updates, reducing data transmission compared to periodic full snapshots. CCXT leverages this by establishing a websocket connection to receive snapshots and updates, allowing for real-time order book accuracy without frequent REST API calls. This approach aligns with efficient order book processing using websocket diff streams.

• Use `uvloop` on *nix (drop-in `import uvloop, asyncio; uvloop.install()`).

──────────────────────────────────
6. Profiling & Tooling
──────────────────────────────────
• Add a `--profile` CLI flag that starts `yappi` and dumps a flamegraph on exit.  
• Integrate `tracemalloc` snapshots around high-frequency loops to watch for unintended allocations.
