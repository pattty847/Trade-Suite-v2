    """
    Fetches all markets from the given exchange, filters them by the quote currency,
    sorts them by a specified volume field (descending), and returns the top X symbols.

    Args:
        exchange: The ccxt.Exchange object (async version).
        quote_currency: The quote currency to filter by (e.g., 'USD', 'USDT').
        count: The number of top symbols to return.
        volume_field: The key in the market['info'] dictionary that contains the quote volume.
                      For Coinbase, 'volume_24h' typically represents 24h volume in the quote currency.
                      For other exchanges, this might be 'quoteVolume' directly in market or another info field.

    Returns:
        A list of the top X symbols (e.g., ['BTC/USD', 'ETH/USD']).
        Returns an empty list if markets cannot be fetched or no matching markets are found.
