# Trade-Suite-v2: Technical Overview & Recent Improvements

## Project Overview
Trade-Suite-v2 is a cryptocurrency trading dashboard built with Python, featuring real-time market data visualization, technical analysis capabilities, and order book visualization. It uses Dear PyGui (DPG) for the UI and ccxt.pro for accessing exchange APIs and websocket streams.

## Architecture & Key Components

### Core Components
- **Viewport (`viewport.py`)**: Main application container that manages the DPG lifecycle and render loop.
- **Data Layer (`data_source.py`)**: Manages connections to exchanges via `CCXTInterface` and processes market data.
- **Task Manager (`task_manager.py`)**: Orchestrates async tasks on a dedicated asyncio thread.
- **Signal System (`signals.py`)**: Event system for communication between components.
- **GUI Components**: Chart, OrderBook, Trading panel, etc. that subscribe to signals and render data.

### Data Flow
1. The `TaskManager` runs async tasks (via `Data`) on a background thread.
2. These tasks fetch real-time data from exchange websockets via `ccxt.pro`.
3. When data arrives, `Data` methods emit signals with the new information.
4. GUI components (Chart, OrderBook) subscribe to these signals and update themselves.

## Recent Improvements: Thread-Safety & Signal Handling

### The Problem
The application had a critical thread-safety issue: signals emitted from the background asyncio thread were trying to update DPG UI components directly. In GUI frameworks like DPG, UI updates must happen on the main thread.

### The Solution
We implemented a thread-safe signal system using a queue:

1. **Thread Detection in SignalEmitter**:
   ```python
   def emit(self, signal: Signals, *args, **kwargs):
       if threading.get_ident() == self._main_thread_id:
           # Direct execution if on main thread
           self._execute_callbacks(signal, args, kwargs)
       else:
           # Queue for later if on background thread
           self._queue.put((signal, args, kwargs))
   ```

2. **Queue Processing in Main Thread**:
   ```python
   def process_signal_queue(self, sender=None, app_data=None, user_data=None):
       while not self._queue.empty():
           signal, args, kwargs = self._queue.get_nowait()
           self._execute_callbacks(signal, args, kwargs)
   ```

3. **Custom Render Loop**:
   ```python
   # In viewport.py
   while dpg.is_dearpygui_running():
       # Process signals before each frame
       self.data.emitter.process_signal_queue()
       dpg.render_dearpygui_frame()
   ```

This ensures all UI updates from real-time data occur safely on the main thread while allowing background tasks to run efficiently.

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- The application efficiently handles high-frequency data from crypto exchanges.
- All exchanges are connected via ccxt.pro's websocket interfaces.
- Order book visualization uses pandas DataFrames for aggregation by price levels.

### Future Optimizations
For better performance with high-frequency data flows:

1. **DataFrames in Callbacks**: Consider optimizing or limiting the use of pandas DataFrames in real-time callbacks.
2. **Signal Rate Limiting**: Implement throttling for high-frequency signals (especially order book updates).
3. **Selective UI Updates**: Update UI elements selectively based on visibility and importance.
4. **DPG Debug Tools**: Use DPG's debug tools to monitor frame rates and identify rendering bottlenecks.

## Exchange Authentication
The application now supports Coinbase Advanced Trade API authentication, which uses `apiKey` (API Key) and `secret` (Private Key) credentials. Environmental variables are used for secure credential management.

## Technical Design Patterns

The project employs several key design patterns:
- **Observer Pattern**: Via the signal/event system
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies through constructors
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating UI components and handling data transformations
- **Command Pattern**: For task execution in the background thread

This architecture allows for a responsive UI while handling high-frequency data streams, with clear separation between data processing and visualization.
